        <div class="intro">
        <p> I have recently completed a full-time MSc Biomechanics degree at the University of Loughborough and I am now keen to launch a career in the exciting world of information technology.<br>
            I have acquired strong analytical and critical thinking skills through classifying and assessing a wide range of information by planning and conducting laboratory experiments designed to assess human locomotion.<br>
            Turned professional in football at the age of 18 in Israel and it required me to become autonomous at an early age.<br>
            Although my career ended early due to several injuries, I managed to pick up Hebrew at a conversational level and learnt how to thrive as a member of a team.</p> </div>
